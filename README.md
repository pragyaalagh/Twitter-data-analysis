# Twitter-data-analysis

The data available on Twitter is an extremely valuable resource to gather information about the interaction of any company with it's customers. People often post about their experiences with various products and services that they use with the online community. Lately, this has been especially prevelant on Twitter. 
This makes data collected from Twitter a great place to do market analysis, comparing a buisness with it's competitors and gathering the demographic and information about the users of the service that can be extremely useful in making various buisness decisions. 

One of the segments for which this data can prove to be immensely useful is online food ordering services. These services often cater to their customer greivances through their Twitter handle, which means that they generate a huge amount of data about their customer interactions, service problem areas as well as how they fare against their competitors. 

Through this project, I will demonstrate the methodology of analysing twitter data right from mining the data via python to creating visualizations that will help decision makers in understanding their business.

This project is divided into the following segments:

1. Data Scrapping and Mining using Python

2. Understanding the attributes of Twitter data 

3. Arranging Data and Extracting useful information 

4. Data Analysis and graphical representations
